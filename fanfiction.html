        <span style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Oxygen', sans-serif;"><b>A TAIL IN SHAD0W (Warriors)</b></span><br><br>
      <br>
      The black kit scrambled clumsily over rocks toward the cool earth. The sun glinted off its eyes making the kit turn away and nestle its tiny head in a patch of grass along the floor of the nursery. It shivered, still cold and wet, but angled its ears towards the huddle of cats in the nursery. “Of course I can’t tell you what it looks like” snorted a cat in an annoyed tone. “Don’t worry Cinderheart” mewed a softer voice, “she’s very pretty and has her father’s golden pelt.” His mother gave an approving purr. 
      The brambles at the front of the nursery shook as a large well muscled golden cat appeared. His eyes immediately softened into love, after seeing the small she-kit. The black kit stayed hidden his fur raised at the new voice. “How are they Jayfeather, they look beautiful! Where is the other one, I heard you say there were two?” “Noisy furball” scoffed the annoyed cat.</br>
      A soft paw gingerly picked up the black kit and dropped him off near his mother’s downy fur. He pushed himself around and started suckling. “He was hidden under a leaf over there in the shadows.” mewed the softer voice gently “Thanks Daisy” the loud cat purred although an edge of distrust marred his voice. Jayfeather sighed and padded out of the den “Let me get some borage for your milk Cinderheart” he called. Cinderheart his mother turned over “Both of my kits - together.” She purred, happily curling her tail around them “We were thinking about names for a tom, Shadowkit I think right Lionblaze?” she purred eyeing the black kit. Distractedly Lionblaze assented. Contently, Cinderheart allowed Shadowkit and the golden she-kit to suckle, testing his name. 
      “What No, I thought we said Shadekit” Lionblaze trailed off, his mate replying “I like Shadow more.” “But. . .” Lionblaze stammered weakly. Daisy nudged Lionblaze amused “she’s your mate.” “Shadowkit” Lionblaze tested. “Jayfeather is that even allowed?” “Mmfh? Jayfeather replied looking up from his bundle of borage. “What Lionblaze is trying to say, is that Cinderheart wants to name her black tom Shadowkit, but we have no idea if thats allowed.” Daisy replied, curling up near Cinderheart and gazing at the kits. “I don’t know ask Bramblestar!” he snapped back. Is he always angry? Shadowkit thought.</br>
      * * *</br>
      Not even one sunhigh and already the kits are causing problems Lionblaze thought with a sigh as he padded over to Bramblestar’s den shaking stray brambles off his fur from the nursery. I used to think he was my father. At least my kits will know exactly who their mother is. Lionblaze thought bitterly. And Cinderheart will be a much better mother than Leafpool could ever dream of. 
      “Something wrong Lionblaze?” Bramblestar questioned inquisitively. “Not really” he replied. “Cinderheart wants to name one of our kits Shadowkit and she won’t let me convince her otherwise.” he burst out. “Jayfeather said to ask you if that was allowed.” Bramblestar paused before answering “I don’t really know with Shadowclan and all, but if thats what she really wants I guess we have no way to say no” Bramblestar purred, with a glance at Squirrelflight who was sunning herself on a rock and flicking her tail lazily, her belly swollen with kits. “I mean its not like we are going to change it later - and its a fine name to me” Lionblaze replied closing the subject. 
      “How is Squirrelflight?” he said in a more cheery tune “She’s fine, your brother says she will have 3 kits”. I wonder what kind of mother she will be to them - her own kits. “Well . . .” Lionblaze paused his hackles raising at the thought. “I know what you think Lionblaze, but that was really Leafpool’s fault. You can’t really blame Squirrelflight for her she had to help!” Lionblaze wove his tail angrily. I can’t really blame Bramblstar at all - he had no idea and was a great father to us anyway. “Squirrelflight lied” he asserted “But its all over now. I’m sure you will be a great father to them - you were to us” Lionblaze said tentatively. 
      Bramblestar’s face flushed at his response and a faint smile. “I thought you were mine you know they never told me” “Yeah I can’t say anything else other than thanks for what you did” Lionblaze replied abashed at the way he was treating a cat who had only shown him love and compassion as a kit. “Well good luck with your kits I’ll be seeing Cinderheart now.” Lionblaze sighed unable to form more words. “Good luck with yours Lionblaze I’m sure you will be an excellent father.” Lionblaze flicked his tail in thanks and padded back to the nursery.
      Lionblaze quietly entered the den and padded over to where Jayfeather was sitting. He looked at the kits their tiny chests moving up and down against the flank of their mother who was serenely dozing her soft breath showing against the cool night. It’s beautiful Lionblaze thought gazing at his family. He sat down next to Jayfeather a strong draft of frosty leafbare wind. 
      “Was it a mistake in leafbare?” he whispered to Jayfeather. “I don’t really see how there is any problem, many queens have had kits in leafbare that grew to great cats. We were born in leafbare!” Jayfeather reasuured him “Yeah but our birth wasn’t really ideal.” “You’ll be fine don’t worry. All first time fathers worry so much it’s so annoying. Cinderheart is a strong queen.” “What aren’t you annoyed by Jayfeather” Lionblaze replied smirking. “Anyway I’ll be off to the warriors den it’s getting late.” Lionblaze sighed and walked slowly gazing at starpelt. All those cat all of them had mothers and they were fine. Lionblaze thought before entering the warriors den. He smiled and pressed his paw into his nest before curling up into a comfortable shape and dozing off.
      </br>* * *</br>
      Lionblaze padded into camp, two mice hung limply in his jaws. Dropping one on the fresh kill pile, he chose the better mouse, and a fat warm vole and stole away to the nursery. Cinderheart sat up at his arrival, the kits still asleep. Lionblaze dropped the vole in front of her “I know you love vole Cinderheart, have some you need to be strong and have lots of milk” The smoky-gray tabby smiled and began to devour the vole exausted from caring for the kits. Lionheart licked his children “There so small!” he purred “Getting bigger each day” his mate laughed pushing her head into Lionblaze’s flank affectionately. He bent over and licked the top of her head before settling down.
      </br>* * *</br>
      Cinderheart pressed her head into her kits her smoky fur a stark contrast to their black and golden pelts. Neither of them completely resembled cats she had seen before, a female version of Lionblaze with her features, and a black tom with white paws that if anything looked a bit like Hollyleaf used to, but in color only. He had a small lithe body and had just opened his eyes peering around with interest. 
      She reflected back on the day of his birth thoughts flying through her mind. I don’t really remember what I was saying. Shadowkit what a name I must have been really delirious. I wonder what will his first gathering be like? I still have to raise him and his sister before thinking about those things. She sighed. Lionblaze entered the den. He comes so often now days she noticed. I guess it’s because he feels like his kits deserve more than Squirrelflight and Leafpool ever gave him and his littermates she decided 
      “They’re finally opening their eyes!” Lionblaze purred happily. “Maybe we can name the other one, hopefully properly this time” Cinderheart replied sagely. “The clan was pretty surprised at my last choice so you should name her Lionblaze” “Sure” he laughed. “Remember Stormfur?” “Yes what about him?” “I think we should name our she-kit after (something idk yet ill placehold Bkit)” “Probably better than Shadow” Cinderheart laughed. “Shadowkit and Bkit” Lionblaze tested their names together happily his tail curling around them. He bent down and licked their heads and they looked up at him with their large eyes. 
      Shadowkit had greenish blue eyes with large black pupils, while Bkit had turqoise eyes and smaller pupils that framed her orangish-golden pelt well. After cocking her head at the large tom, Bkit buried her head into her mothers flank. Shadowkit however stared up at Lionblaze narrowing his eyes. Lionblaze laughed and the embarrassed kit followed his sister burying  his head quickly in a mass of grey fur. 
      After a moments pause though he couldn’t steal his gaze away from Lionblaze and looked back shifting to take a new angle at the golden tom. “Hi there Shadowkit!” Lionblaze purred. To everyones surprise he answered softly and abashedly “Hi”. “You can talk?” Lionblazed noticed adeptly. Cinderheart rolled her eyes at her mate’s tactless comment. He realized his mistake at Shadowkits immediate show of fright “I guess I’m not allowed to?” the kits eyes widened realizing his mistake and immediately curling into a ball. Cinderheart exchanged a glance of contempt with Lionblaze who looked defensive. “No it’s fine Shadowkit you’re just a bit early. Nothing bad of course” Lionblaze hurriedly replied his gaze darting to his mate for approval. Cinderheart sighed and shook her head toms she thought before bending down and licking Bkit. Shadowkit looked up “So there’s nothing wrong with me? I heard Jayfeather irritatedly about me being able to talk to quickly two sunhigh’s ago so I made it look like I could only repeat what others said” the kit explained hurriedly stopping to catch his breath, his fur fluffing out as his breaths tumbled over each other. 
      “Slow down” Lionblaze laughed. Cinderheart however looked hurt at the kits comment. “Jayfeather!” she huffed “Probably was annoyed that some elder needed their bedding cleaned out” she paused catching her breath “Should have never talked in that tone around kits” she said curling her tail around Shadowkit. “You know Jayfeather is always like that Cinderheart” “Yes but still only he could make it sound like speaking early is a bad thing.” Shadowkit looked more amused now “Jayfether always seems like someone put brambles in his nest.”  he said. Lionblaze gritted his teeth “He can be like that but he has a better side” “He’s your father’s brother Shadowkit” Cinderheart pointed out 
      “So Lionblaze probably can’t see him for who he is - an ever irritated furball!” Shadowkit exclaimed earning him a laugh from his mother and a hurt look from his father. “An ever irritated furball that is giving your mother borage so you can suckle happily!” A snide voice scoffed. Shadowkit terrified, shrank back at the sight of Jayfeather “Sorry” he muttered. “Should be” Jayfeather said dropping more borage off for Cinderheart. “Here take this” “Thanks Jayfeather.” Shadowkit shrank back towards Bkit “I guess I’m going to sleep” he whispered before taking his place next to his littermate. “What do you mean you guess” Jayfeather pointed out before leaving the den. “You should get to know him Shadowkit he’s really a nice cat who cares for you at heart.” “Ok” Shadowkit decided meekly before yawning and burying his head in the soft moss. “I wonder if his sister will be like him” Cinderheart laughed. “Then you’ll have more than you can handle Lionblaze replied smiling “Might want to get Jayfeather over to scare them.” The two mates chuckled and talked softly throughout the night as the moon rose and Starpelt revealed itself. 
      </br>* * *</br>
      Shadowkit focused his attention on a stray leaf in the nursery. If I’m going to be a warrior I might as well start training now he thought I can be my own mentor until I am six moons old and I’ll show the forest what a Thunderclan apprentice can do! He wriggled  in exitement and then padded foreward as quietly as he could before leaping and piercing the leaf with his claw feeling it crackle. “Fine but keep your tail up for balance and back down closer to the ground.” Lionblaze lazily noted. Shadowkit nodded maybe if I can master this than I can go catch real prey! he moved back and made sure his paws didn’t make sounds as he stalked across the floor of the den. He forced his haunches down and kept his tail up for balance. His legs pushed back, and he leapt at the leaf, his gaze however, turned towards a stray moth that had just entered the nursery. 
      Turning his head, his paws flew out toward the moth. Pain flared through him as he hit the side of the nursery wall forcefully. The moth flitted out the den entrance, and once the pain receded Shadowkit was left looking a bit flustered. Cinderheart immediately stood up, to the protest of Bkit, and padded over to the black tom. “Shadowkit!” she exclaimed “Are you ok?” “I’m fine I’m fine I just wasn’t looking where I was going!” Why do they always fuss so much! I’m fine! Shadowkit thought. 
      “Real warriors look where they’re going and don’t chase moths instead of prey” Lionblaze noted with a flick of his tail. “Well the moth is closer to real prey than a leaf” mumbled Shadowkit. “Forget about it” Cinderheart exclaimed “Squirrelflight’s kits are being named!” 
      Squirrelflight had kitted a couple sunhighs ago, and had had three kits. Two toms and one little she-kit. One tom was cream colored while the other was grey with black stripes. The she-kit was a ginger tabby with deep blue eyes. Shadowkit and his sister had tried to play with the new kits, but every time they got close to playing a game, Squirrelflight or Cinderheart would call them off. What’s the point of being a kit if you can’t play? Shadowkit had thought but later realized that soon he and Bkit could play with the new kits after they had opened their eyes and gained some strength. Still, it couldn’t hurt to try early he had thought. Now though, they had been able to talk to the kits multiple times before Squirrelflight could try to force them to feed or rest. He had grown close to the cream colored tom, over their fleeting talks. 
      Shadowkit padded towards the center of camp, where Bramblestar was standing, proud for his kits, as his mate licked her kits over and over grooming them for their naming ceremony. The cream tom jumped out of his mothers grasp as she was grooming the ginger she-kit, and leapt over to his father who only smiled and heralded him back to his mother who reprimanded him sharply before continuing to lick him all over. Bramblestar leapt to the Highledge. Shadowkit looked up but his ears caught Lionblaze and Jayfeather talikng in hushed voices. “I wonder if she was this happy about us or if she didn’t really care” Lionblaze whispered. “It was more of Leafpool’s fault to begin with, and wouldn’t you take in my kits if I had any?” “Well first of all you aren’t a she-cat” “Say some rouge” “Really Jayfeather” Lionblaze scoffed “But still I see what you mean.” 
      They’re just talking about Squirrelflight and how she lied that Lionblaze Jayfeather and Hollyleaf were her real kits. I’ve heard elder stories about that but no one really seems to care anymore, I mean they turned out fine - if it were me I would have thanked Squirrelflight for a job well done! Shadowkit’s attention however focused on Bramblestar as he yowled “Let all cats old enough to catch their own prey gather here beneath the Highledge for a Clan meeting!" I can’t catch my own prey yet, but Shadowkit paused I guess I’ll sneak out of camp later to catch some prey so I can really belong! Maybe I’ll even get practice to be a warrior! Shadowkit burst with happiness as he pondered the plan.
      </br>* * *</br>
        The three newly named kits, Pebblekit, Eaglekit and Springkit burst out of the nursery tails bobbing, and faces full. The clan seemed so unsettled when Bramblestar announced my name. Is there anything wrong with Shadowkit? he thought When Bkit was named, the clan seemed almost relived, and all the warriors and apprentices were giving me looks, as if I was some sort of rouge or loner that had just entered Thunderclan. At least they seem happier now that I’m a normal kit. Pebblekit, Springkit and Eaglekit are so happy though so I should talk to them and play now that we are allowed to instead of thinking about this Shadowkit decided. 
      Warriors don’t think about what other clanmates think - they prove themselves in battle, and then the clan judges them by that. Like Lionblaze, he’s so strong, and so fit and thats what the clan sees in him, not the fact that Leafpool and Crowfeather mated to produce him! I’ll just have to be the best fighter in the forest! 
      Shadowkit bounded over to the kits. “Wanna play?” Shadowkit called. “Sure!” Pebblekit answered scrambling over to the black tom. Springkit also padded over, although a little slower than her brother. Shadowkit noticed Eaglekit seemed more reserved and didn’t come over at Bkit’s calls. “Leave him” Pebblekit called “He’s always like that.” “Okay then” Shadowkit replied. You and your sister be Shadowclan leader and Deputy, and I’ll be the brave Thunderclan warrior leading a patrol with Bkit, and we’ll fight you!” 
      “Shouldn’t we be on different teams Shadowkit?” Bkit pointed out “I mean we are bigger than them “Sure I guess, me and Pebblekit can be Thunderclan” “Shadowkit doesn’t it make more sense for you to be the Shadowclan leader?” Pebblekit noted Why did they have to think of that of all things? Shadowkit’s mind raced furiously but their new kits so I’ll just go along with it he decided before padding off to the center of camp. 
      Bkit and Springkit moved to one side of the ravine, while Pebblekit and Shadowkit bounded to just under the Highledge. “Okay so we should attack from the left side because that has the advantage” Pebblekit decided. “Yes thats true, but knowing my sister, she will try to attack from that side and gain a better position, because she knows we will try to go for that side” Shadowkit asserted with a casual glance to where Bkit and Springkit were talking hurridly. 
      “I think we should try to use that and go around from the other side and try to surprise them” he suggested. Pebblekit stunned by Shadowkits reasoning could only reply “Yeah that sounds really smart!” The two kits padded out softly and furtively moving behind bushes to the point where Bkit and Springkit lie waiting for them to try to take the advantage. I can’t belive that soon I’ll be an apprentice doing this everyday! I can’t wait till I’m a warrior and I can actually fight with my claws instead of them sheathed! Shadowtail squirmed with excitement I’m going to be a warrior!!

      CHAPTER ONE: <br>
      The black kit scrambled clumsily over rocks toward the cool earth. The sun glinted off its eyes making the kit turn away and nestle its tiny head in a patch of grass along the floor of the nursery. It shivered, still cold and wet, but angled its ears towards the huddle of cats in the nursery. “Of course I can’t tell you what it looks like” snorted a cat in an annoyed tone. “Don’t worry Cinderheart” mewed a softer voice, “she’s very pretty and has her father’s golden pelt.” His mother gave an approving purr. 
      The brambles at the front of the nursery shook as a large well muscled golden cat appeared. His eyes immediately softened into love, after seeing the small she-kit. The black kit stayed hidden his fur raised at the new voice. “How are they Jayfeather, they look beautiful! Where is the other one, I heard you say there were two?” “Noisy furball” scoffed the annoyed cat.</br>
      A soft paw gingerly picked up the black kit and dropped him off near his mother’s downy fur. He pushed himself around and started suckling. “He was hidden under a leaf over there in the shadows.” mewed the softer voice gently “Thanks Daisy” the loud cat purred although an edge of distrust marred his voice. Jayfeather sighed and padded out of the den “Let me get some borage for your milk Cinderheart” he called. Cinderheart his mother turned over “Both of my kits - together.” She purred, happily curling her tail around them “We were thinking about names for a tom, Shadowkit I think right Lionblaze?” she purred eyeing the black kit. Distractedly Lionblaze assented. Contently, Cinderheart allowed Shadowkit and the golden she-kit to suckle, testing his name. 
      “What No, I thought we said Shadekit” Lionblaze trailed off, his mate replying “I like Shadow more.” “But. . .” Lionblaze stammered weakly. Daisy nudged Lionblaze amused “she’s your mate.” “Shadowkit” Lionblaze tested. “Jayfeather is that even allowed?” “Mmfh? Jayfeather replied looking up from his bundle of borage. “What Lionblaze is trying to say, is that Cinderheart wants to name her black tom Shadowkit, but we have no idea if thats allowed.” Daisy replied, curling up near Cinderheart and gazing at the kits. “I don’t know ask Bramblestar!” he snapped back. Is he always angry? Shadowkit thought.</br>
      * * *</br>
      Not even one sunhigh and already the kits are causing problems Lionblaze thought with a sigh as he padded over to Bramblestar’s den shaking stray brambles off his fur from the nursery. I used to think he was my father. At least my kits will know exactly who their mother is. Lionblaze thought bitterly. And Cinderheart will be a much better mother than Leafpool could ever dream of. 
      “Something wrong Lionblaze?” Bramblestar questioned inquisitively. “Not really” he replied. “Cinderheart wants to name one of our kits Shadowkit and she won’t let me convince her otherwise.” he burst out. “Jayfeather said to ask you if that was allowed.” Bramblestar paused before answering “I don’t really know with Shadowclan and all, but if thats what she really wants I guess we have no way to say no” Bramblestar purred, with a glance at Squirrelflight who was sunning herself on a rock and flicking her tail lazily, her belly swollen with kits. “I mean its not like we are going to change it later - and its a fine name to me” Lionblaze replied closing the subject. 
      “How is Squirrelflight?” he said in a more cheery tune “She’s fine, your brother says she will have 3 kits”. I wonder what kind of mother she will be to them - her own kits. “Well . . .” Lionblaze paused his hackles raising at the thought. “I know what you think Lionblaze, but that was really Leafpool’s fault. You can’t really blame Squirrelflight for her she had to help!” Lionblaze wove his tail angrily. I can’t really blame Bramblstar at all - he had no idea and was a great father to us anyway. “Squirrelflight lied” he asserted “But its all over now. I’m sure you will be a great father to them - you were to us” Lionblaze said tentatively. 
      Bramblestar’s face flushed at his response and a faint smile. “I thought you were mine you know they never told me” “Yeah I can’t say anything else other than thanks for what you did” Lionblaze replied abashed at the way he was treating a cat who had only shown him love and compassion as a kit. “Well good luck with your kits I’ll be seeing Cinderheart now.” Lionblaze sighed unable to form more words. “Good luck with yours Lionblaze I’m sure you will be an excellent father.” Lionblaze flicked his tail in thanks and padded back to the nursery.
      Lionblaze quietly entered the den and padded over to where Jayfeather was sitting. He looked at the kits their tiny chests moving up and down against the flank of their mother who was serenely dozing her soft breath showing against the cool night. It’s beautiful Lionblaze thought gazing at his family. He sat down next to Jayfeather a strong draft of frosty leafbare wind. 
      “Was it a mistake in leafbare?” he whispered to Jayfeather. “I don’t really see how there is any problem, many queens have had kits in leafbare that grew to great cats. We were born in leafbare!” Jayfeather reasuured him “Yeah but our birth wasn’t really ideal.” “You’ll be fine don’t worry. All first time fathers worry so much it’s so annoying. Cinderheart is a strong queen.” “What aren’t you annoyed by Jayfeather” Lionblaze replied smirking. “Anyway I’ll be off to the warriors den it’s getting late.” Lionblaze sighed and walked slowly gazing at starpelt. All those cat all of them had mothers and they were fine. Lionblaze thought before entering the warriors den. He smiled and pressed his paw into his nest before curling up into a comfortable shape and dozing off.
      </br>* * *</br>
      Lionblaze padded into camp, two mice hung limply in his jaws. Dropping one on the fresh kill pile, he chose the better mouse, and a fat warm vole and stole away to the nursery. Cinderheart sat up at his arrival, the kits still asleep. Lionblaze dropped the vole in front of her “I know you love vole Cinderheart, have some you need to be strong and have lots of milk” The smoky-gray tabby smiled and began to devour the vole exausted from caring for the kits. Lionheart licked his children “There so small!” he purred “Getting bigger each day” his mate laughed pushing her head into Lionblaze’s flank affectionately. He bent over and licked the top of her head before settling down.
      </br>* * *</br>
      Cinderheart pressed her head into her kits her smoky fur a stark contrast to their black and golden pelts. Neither of them completely resembled cats she had seen before, a female version of Lionblaze with her features, and a black tom with white paws that if anything looked a bit like Hollyleaf used to, but in color only. He had a small lithe body and had just opened his eyes peering around with interest. 
      She reflected back on the day of his birth thoughts flying through her mind. I don’t really remember what I was saying. Shadowkit what a name I must have been really delirious. I wonder what will his first gathering be like? I still have to raise him and his sister before thinking about those things. She sighed. Lionblaze entered the den. He comes so often now days she noticed. I guess it’s because he feels like his kits deserve more than Squirrelflight and Leafpool ever gave him and his littermates she decided 
      “They’re finally opening their eyes!” Lionblaze purred happily. “Maybe we can name the other one, hopefully properly this time” Cinderheart replied sagely. “The clan was pretty surprised at my last choice so you should name her Lionblaze” “Sure” he laughed. “Remember Stormfur?” “Yes what about him?” “I think we should name our she-kit after (something idk yet ill placehold Bkit)” “Probably better than Shadow” Cinderheart laughed. “Shadowkit and Bkit” Lionblaze tested their names together happily his tail curling around them. He bent down and licked their heads and they looked up at him with their large eyes. 
      Shadowkit had greenish blue eyes with large black pupils, while Bkit had turqoise eyes and smaller pupils that framed her orangish-golden pelt well. After cocking her head at the large tom, Bkit buried her head into her mothers flank. Shadowkit however stared up at Lionblaze narrowing his eyes. Lionblaze laughed and the embarrassed kit followed his sister burying  his head quickly in a mass of grey fur. 
      After a moments pause though he couldn’t steal his gaze away from Lionblaze and looked back shifting to take a new angle at the golden tom. “Hi there Shadowkit!” Lionblaze purred. To everyones surprise he answered softly and abashedly “Hi”. “You can talk?” Lionblazed noticed adeptly. Cinderheart rolled her eyes at her mate’s tactless comment. He realized his mistake at Shadowkits immediate show of fright “I guess I’m not allowed to?” the kits eyes widened realizing his mistake and immediately curling into a ball. Cinderheart exchanged a glance of contempt with Lionblaze who looked defensive. “No it’s fine Shadowkit you’re just a bit early. Nothing bad of course” Lionblaze hurriedly replied his gaze darting to his mate for approval. Cinderheart sighed and shook her head toms she thought before bending down and licking Bkit. Shadowkit looked up “So there’s nothing wrong with me? I heard Jayfeather irritatedly about me being able to talk to quickly two sunhigh’s ago so I made it look like I could only repeat what others said” the kit explained hurriedly stopping to catch his breath, his fur fluffing out as his breaths tumbled over each other. 
      “Slow down” Lionblaze laughed. Cinderheart however looked hurt at the kits comment. “Jayfeather!” she huffed “Probably was annoyed that some elder needed their bedding cleaned out” she paused catching her breath “Should have never talked in that tone around kits” she said curling her tail around Shadowkit. “You know Jayfeather is always like that Cinderheart” “Yes but still only he could make it sound like speaking early is a bad thing.” Shadowkit looked more amused now “Jayfether always seems like someone put brambles in his nest.”  he said. Lionblaze gritted his teeth “He can be like that but he has a better side” “He’s your father’s brother Shadowkit” Cinderheart pointed out 
      “So Lionblaze probably can’t see him for who he is - an ever irritated furball!” Shadowkit exclaimed earning him a laugh from his mother and a hurt look from his father. “An ever irritated furball that is giving your mother borage so you can suckle happily!” A snide voice scoffed. Shadowkit terrified, shrank back at the sight of Jayfeather “Sorry” he muttered. “Should be” Jayfeather said dropping more borage off for Cinderheart. “Here take this” “Thanks Jayfeather.” Shadowkit shrank back towards Bkit “I guess I’m going to sleep” he whispered before taking his place next to his littermate. “What do you mean you guess” Jayfeather pointed out before leaving the den. “You should get to know him Shadowkit he’s really a nice cat who cares for you at heart.” “Ok” Shadowkit decided meekly before yawning and burying his head in the soft moss. “I wonder if his sister will be like him” Cinderheart laughed. “Then you’ll have more than you can handle Lionblaze replied smiling “Might want to get Jayfeather over to scare them.” The two mates chuckled and talked softly throughout the night as the moon rose and Starpelt revealed itself. 
      </br>* * *</br>
      Shadowkit focused his attention on a stray leaf in the nursery. If I’m going to be a warrior I might as well start training now he thought I can be my own mentor until I am six moons old and I’ll show the forest what a Thunderclan apprentice can do! He wriggled  in exitement and then padded foreward as quietly as he could before leaping and piercing the leaf with his claw feeling it crackle. “Fine but keep your tail up for balance and back down closer to the ground.” Lionblaze lazily noted. Shadowkit nodded maybe if I can master this than I can go catch real prey! he moved back and made sure his paws didn’t make sounds as he stalked across the floor of the den. He forced his haunches down and kept his tail up for balance. His legs pushed back, and he leapt at the leaf, his gaze however, turned towards a stray moth that had just entered the nursery. 
      Turning his head, his paws flew out toward the moth. Pain flared through him as he hit the side of the nursery wall forcefully. The moth flitted out the den entrance, and once the pain receded Shadowkit was left looking a bit flustered. Cinderheart immediately stood up, to the protest of Bkit, and padded over to the black tom. “Shadowkit!” she exclaimed “Are you ok?” “I’m fine I’m fine I just wasn’t looking where I was going!” Why do they always fuss so much! I’m fine! Shadowkit thought. 
      “Real warriors look where they’re going and don’t chase moths instead of prey” Lionblaze noted with a flick of his tail. “Well the moth is closer to real prey than a leaf” mumbled Shadowkit. “Forget about it” Cinderheart exclaimed “Squirrelflight’s kits are being named!” 
      Squirrelflight had kitted a couple sunhighs ago, and had had three kits. Two toms and one little she-kit. One tom was cream colored while the other was grey with black stripes. The she-kit was a ginger tabby with deep blue eyes. Shadowkit and his sister had tried to play with the new kits, but every time they got close to playing a game, Squirrelflight or Cinderheart would call them off. What’s the point of being a kit if you can’t play? Shadowkit had thought but later realized that soon he and Bkit could play with the new kits after they had opened their eyes and gained some strength. Still, it couldn’t hurt to try early he had thought. Now though, they had been able to talk to the kits multiple times before Squirrelflight could try to force them to feed or rest. He had grown close to the cream colored tom, over their fleeting talks. 
      Shadowkit padded towards the center of camp, where Bramblestar was standing, proud for his kits, as his mate licked her kits over and over grooming them for their naming ceremony. The cream tom jumped out of his mothers grasp as she was grooming the ginger she-kit, and leapt over to his father who only smiled and heralded him back to his mother who reprimanded him sharply before continuing to lick him all over. Bramblestar leapt to the Highledge. Shadowkit looked up but his ears caught Lionblaze and Jayfeather talikng in hushed voices. “I wonder if she was this happy about us or if she didn’t really care” Lionblaze whispered. “It was more of Leafpool’s fault to begin with, and wouldn’t you take in my kits if I had any?” “Well first of all you aren’t a she-cat” “Say some rouge” “Really Jayfeather” Lionblaze scoffed “But still I see what you mean.” 
      They’re just talking about Squirrelflight and how she lied that Lionblaze Jayfeather and Hollyleaf were her real kits. I’ve heard elder stories about that but no one really seems to care anymore, I mean they turned out fine - if it were me I would have thanked Squirrelflight for a job well done! Shadowkit’s attention however focused on Bramblestar as he yowled “Let all cats old enough to catch their own prey gather here beneath the Highledge for a Clan meeting!" I can’t catch my own prey yet, but Shadowkit paused I guess I’ll sneak out of camp later to catch some prey so I can really belong! Maybe I’ll even get practice to be a warrior! Shadowkit burst with happiness as he pondered the plan.
      </br>* * *</br>
        The three newly named kits, Pebblekit, Eaglekit and Springkit burst out of the nursery tails bobbing, and faces full. The clan seemed so unsettled when Bramblestar announced my name. Is there anything wrong with Shadowkit? he thought When Bkit was named, the clan seemed almost relived, and all the warriors and apprentices were giving me looks, as if I was some sort of rouge or loner that had just entered Thunderclan. At least they seem happier now that I’m a normal kit. Pebblekit, Springkit and Eaglekit are so happy though so I should talk to them and play now that we are allowed to instead of thinking about this Shadowkit decided. 
      Warriors don’t think about what other clanmates think - they prove themselves in battle, and then the clan judges them by that. Like Lionblaze, he’s so strong, and so fit and thats what the clan sees in him, not the fact that Leafpool and Crowfeather mated to produce him! I’ll just have to be the best fighter in the forest! 
      Shadowkit bounded over to the kits. “Wanna play?” Shadowkit called. “Sure!” Pebblekit answered scrambling over to the black tom. Springkit also padded over, although a little slower than her brother. Shadowkit noticed Eaglekit seemed more reserved and didn’t come over at Bkit’s calls. “Leave him” Pebblekit called “He’s always like that.” “Okay then” Shadowkit replied. You and your sister be Shadowclan leader and Deputy, and I’ll be the brave Thunderclan warrior leading a patrol with Bkit, and we’ll fight you!” 
      “Shouldn’t we be on different teams Shadowkit?” Bkit pointed out “I mean we are bigger than them “Sure I guess, me and Pebblekit can be Thunderclan” “Shadowkit doesn’t it make more sense for you to be the Shadowclan leader?” Pebblekit noted Why did they have to think of that of all things? Shadowkit’s mind raced furiously but their new kits so I’ll just go along with it he decided before padding off to the center of camp. 
      Bkit and Springkit moved to one side of the ravine, while Pebblekit and Shadowkit bounded to just under the Highledge. “Okay so we should attack from the left side because that has the advantage” Pebblekit decided. “Yes thats true, but knowing my sister, she will try to attack from that side and gain a better position, because she knows we will try to go for that side” Shadowkit asserted with a casual glance to where Bkit and Springkit were talking hurridly. 
      “I think we should try to use that and go around from the other side and try to surprise them” he suggested. Pebblekit stunned by Shadowkits reasoning could only reply “Yeah that sounds really smart!” The two kits padded out softly and furtively moving behind bushes to the point where Bkit and Springkit lie waiting for them to try to take the advantage. I can’t belive that soon I’ll be an apprentice doing this everyday! I can’t wait till I’m a warrior and I can actually fight with my claws instead of them sheathed! Shadowtail squirmed with excitement I’m going to be a warrior!!
