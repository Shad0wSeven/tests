      <span style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Oxygen', sans-serif;"><b>By Innovation Only (9/10/19)</b></span><br><br>
      That magical week in september, that one day where we start the day in Steve Jobs theatre, applauding as Tim Cook takes the 
      stage, waiting patiently as Apple Arcade and Apple TV+ are released, the refreshed 7th gen iPad, and the all new Watch Series 5, until
      those nine words hit our ears. "Now lets talk about the future of iPhone". The joy that follows can only be expressed as pure giddyness as the animations
      roll and people stribe to guess just how many cameras they stuck on the back. Serieously though last years event was terrible, this year
      was ok, but its not thaaat interesting, with a new 18W charger, 2 more cameras, and updated internals. Theres new colors, and theres the iPhone 11
      11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. A moment for the names. I thought S10+ 5G was bad now mmm Pro Max thats just mmm. pretty bad haul this year, I'd recommend 
      get an X if you need a phone really bad, or wait till 2020 (2021 is slated to remove the notch though yayaay)
      thanks apple!<br>

    After what, like a two decade wait, the korean smartphone giant released another two phones I can never buy. They moved their holepunch
    notch replacement to the center, added Huawei style cameras on the back, and removed the headphone jack citing "space".
    :facepalm: if you can fit an s-pen there how can you not fit a 3.5 millimeter jack??!?!??! Otherwise the reviews are pretty positive.
    Oh yeah and for all you small hand people they got bigger now at 6.5 and 6.8 on the normal and plus respectivly.
    UPGRADES PEOPLE!!!<br>

        After A long wait, and lots of teasing, the Blender Project released Blender 2.8.0 Stable release. This release is monumental, and is pretty much like the difference between iOS 6 and 7. 
        Of course Blender decided to name it 2.8 instead of something cool like 3.0 or X or Omega or Phoenix, or something else. Nevertheless, its a really bountiful update
        and if you are into 3D you should check it out. As for me, I'm still trying to get the hang of 2.79 so I'll ignore that update button for now, 
        but cycles and other features are getting wayyyy better!!!!<br>

        <span style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Oxygen', sans-serif;"><b>iPhone 2019 Rumours (Ongoing)</b></span><br><br>
        As the season gets colder, and the threat of school comes ever closer, a beast lies wating somewhere on the horizon. The second week of September to be exact. 
        That beast, is the iPhone XI or 11 or whatever they'll call it this time. They say they'll look the same on the front, but have an added camera for ugliness. The Xs
        and Xs max replacements will have triple cameras, while the Xr replacement will have 2, it's pretty easy to infer that "Shot on iPhone" will be making quite the comeback 
        this year as cameras are what the apple with the bite taken out of it is focusing on this year. All in all they look really dumb to me, but thats coming from someone who traded
        and Xr for a 6 because faceid and the notch sucks. 2020 looks really cool though!<br>

        <span style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Oxygen', sans-serif;"><b>AMD Ryzen 3rd Generation (7.7.19)</b></span><br><br>
        Third time's the charm. 2 years ago when AMD first released their Intel Core rivals, Ryzen based on the Zen architecture and with the AM4 socket, people
        (like me) thought it would be a cool idea and encouraged AMD to keep going strong, and then turned around and asked for the Core i7 7700k specs again. Well AMD
        was persistant and their 2nd gen was greater than the first, and they boasted immunity to Spectre and Meltdown (If you still remember those xD) They were the Value Champs, and 
        if you wanted a cheap system, that still offered admirable performance, than Ryzen was the way to go. This time, they absolutley destroyed Team Blue. While Santa Clara is mucking 
        around with the semi-falied Coffee Lake Refresh, that no reviewer seems to care about, (except the 9900k) the <i>also</i> Santa Clara CA based AMD fired back some big shots
        with this year's Ryzen. As reviewers get their hands on the chips I can't wait to see Team Blue turn Red.<br>
